#  This next section is here to allow testing of the "inner-tunnel"
#  authentication methods, independently from the "default" server.
#  It is listening on "localhost", so that it can only be used from
#  the same machine.
#
#	$ radtest USER PASSWORD 127.0.0.1:18120 0 testing123
#
#  If it works, you have configured the inner tunnel correctly.  To check
#  if PEAP will work, use:
#
#	$ radtest -t mschap USER PASSWORD 127.0.0.1:18120 0 testing123
#
#  If that works, PEAP should work.  If that command doesn't work, then
#
#	FIX THE INNER TUNNEL CONFIGURATION SO THAT IT WORKS.
#
#  Do NOT do any PEAP tests.  It won't help.  Instead, concentrate
#  on fixing the inner tunnel configuration.  DO NOTHING ELSE.
